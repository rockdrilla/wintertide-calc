## About

`wintertide-calc` is small supplemental calculator for [Path of Building](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding) - powerful application to plan character progression in [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com).

`wintertide-calc` was written to help (me) understand how many damage may character deal with Wintertide Brand skill and relevant items / passive skills.

What's accounted:

- Hierophant's ascendancy passive skill "Sign of Purpose"
- "Witchhunter's Judgment" unique staff and granted skill "Brandsurge"

I may miss to code something - feel free to open issue/PR. :)

## Prerequisites / installation

AFAIK none: use prebuilt release from archive.

PS: runs fine within clean Wine prefix.

## Building from source:

Qt 5+ (Core, Widgets) and CMake 3.5+ are fine.

Or, just use (recent) Qt Creator appliance. :)
